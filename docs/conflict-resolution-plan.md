# Conflict Resolution Plan

To support effective collaboration while accommodating the diverse schedules of team members, all coordination and conflict resolution will be handled asynchronously using GitHubâ€™s project management features. The customer will only be contacted in cases where deliverables or timelines are impacted.

## Task Management and Accountability

- All tasks will be created, assigned, and tracked using GitHub Issues and the Projects tab.
- Each task will include a clear description, deadline, and assignee. Tasks will be broken down as granularly as necessary to ensure transparency and visibility.
- Team members are expected to update the status of their tasks regularly through GitHub comments, project board status changes (e.g., "in progress", "ready for review") and task relationships (e.g. blocked by).

## Missed Deadlines (Individual Tasks)

- If a task deadline is missed without prior notice, it will be flagged within GitHub (e.g., with a comment or label).
- The task will be reassigned if it is time-sensitive or critical to the project timeline.
- The original assignee will be contacted asynchronously to understand the cause of the delay. Workload expectations may be adjusted where appropriate.

## Group Member Withdrawal

- In the event that a team member formally withdraws from the project, their tasks will be redistributed among the remaining members.
- The team will evaluate whether the current scope is still achievable.
- If the team cannot reasonably deliver on time with the reduced capacity, a revised timeline will be proposed to the customer.

## Low-Quality Work

- If a team member consistently submits work that does not meet quality expectations:
  - Constructive feedback will be provided through GitHub pull request comments.
  - They will be assigned simpler or more narrowly scoped tasks.
  - A more experienced member will review their code prior to merging.
- If there is no observable improvement after multiple rounds of feedback and support, the team will stop assigning critical tasks to that member and will plan around reduced capacity. This decision will be communicated transparently to the affected member.
- The customer will not be informed unless overall deliverables are at risk.

## Communication and Documentation

- All important communication will occur within GitHub (issues, pull requests, or discussion threads).
- This ensures all decisions and progress are documented, traceable, and visible to the full team.
- We recognize that unexpected challenges can arise. Team members are encouraged to communicate early if they anticipate delays or need help, so the team can adapt collaboratively.

## Customer Communication

- The customer will only be contacted when deliverables, scope, or timelines are impacted.
- Any communication will clearly explain:
  - The nature of the issue
  - The internal steps taken to address it
  - A proposed solution, such as a revised timeline or re-scoped deliverables

## Technical Disagreements

- Disagreements on design or implementation will be discussed via GitHub Discussions, Issue threads or Discord.
- If consensus cannot be reached within 48 hours, the majority preference will be followed, or a lightweight vote will be held among the team.
- All decisions will be documented in GitHub for future reference.
