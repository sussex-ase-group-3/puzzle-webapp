The group project will be assessed by the module convenor on:

- The scope of the project (i.e. of two otherwise equal projects, the more technically challenging one is likely to get a better mark).
- How well the delivered software meets the specification (a small project that delivers on all its promises will get a better grade than a large project that doesn't).
- The quality of the deliverables, including absence of bugs, and modularity / extensibility of the architecture, design and implementation.
- The quality of the testing process, e.g. degree of coverage, degree of test automation, quality of peer reviews.
- How clear the schedule for each milestone is (where applicable), and how well it is met.
- How well the project group functioned as a working unit.
- How well the group presents its architecture, design and testing process.

Since the project is split into several small deliverables, the overall group mark will be determined from cumulative assessment of the deliverables. Individual marks will be adjusted according to Buddycheck evaluation scores. Here are some suggestions on how to evaluate contributions:

- Quality of work.
- Interest in the project.
- Overall level of participation.
- Understanding what is required.
- Suggesting ideas.
- Extracting something useful from the ideas.
- Performing routine tasks.
- Consolidating (e.g., drawing things together).
- Keeping the group going when things are rough.
- Sorting out problems.
- Initiative: Generating ideas for the activities and methods of solution, finding ideas from other sources.
- Commitment: Doing a fair share of the work, meeting deadlines, attending meetings and being punctual.
- Conducive group behaviour:   Allowing other members to have a fair chance to contribute.
- Responding constructively to each other’s contributions.
